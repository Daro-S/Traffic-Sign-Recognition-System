# Traffic Sign Recognition Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on recognizing traffic signs using a deep learning model. The key components of the project are:

- **Dataset**: GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark) Dataset. You can download it from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign).
- **Model**: The recognition model is based on MobileNetV3 Small, achieving an accuracy of 98% on the test set.

## Project Files

- **Slides**: An overview of the project is available in the slide deck: [Traffic Sign Recognition.pdf](slide/Traffic%20Sign%20Recognition.pdf).
- **Demo Video**: Watch the demo video of the project here: [TrafficSignDemo.mkv](TrafficSignDemo.mkv).
